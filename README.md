What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is like a secret tunnel on the internet.
When you connect to a VPN, all your online traffic goes through this tunnel to a secure server.
This hides your real identity (IP address) and keeps your data safe from others.

✅ Benefits of VPN

1. Privacy Protection – Hides your real IP address and location.

2. Secure Connection – Encrypts your internet data so hackers or snoopers can’t see it.

3. Access Blocked Content – Lets you open websites, apps, or videos that are blocked in your country (like Netflix shows from another country).

4. Safe on Public Wi-Fi – Protects you when using Wi-Fi in cafes, airports, or hotels.

5. Avoid Tracking – Stops websites and advertisers from easily tracking your activity.


⚠️ Limitations of VPN

1. Speed May Slow Down – Because your data takes a longer route through the VPN server.

2. Not 100% Anonymous – VPN hides you, but websites or governments may still track you in some cases.

3. Some Sites Block VPNs – Streaming services, banks, or apps may detect and block VPN usage.

4. Cost – Good VPNs are usually paid; free ones may be unsafe or limited.

5. Trust Issues – You must trust the VPN provider (they can see your traffic if they want).

2) Then check your location by whatismyipaddress.com and you see that real location is show
